Module :mod:`~openquake.hazardlib.calc.filters` contain filter functions for
calculators.

Filters are functions (or other callable objects) that should take generators
and return generators. There are two different kinds of filter functions:

1. Source-site filters. Those functions take a generator of two-item tuples,
   each pair consists of seismic source object (that is, an instance of
   a subclass of :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.source.base.BaseSeismicSource`)
   and a site collection (instance of
   :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.site.SiteCollection`).
2. Rupture-site filters. Those also take a generator of pairs, but in this
   case the first item in the pair is a rupture object (instance of
   :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.source.rupture.Rupture`). The second element in
   generator items is still site collection.

The purpose of both kinds of filters is to limit the amount of calculation
to be done based on some criteria, like the distance between the source
and the site. So common design feature of all the filters is the loop over
pairs of the provided generator, filtering the sites collection, and if
there are no items left in it, skipping the pair and continuing to the next
one. If some sites need to be considered together with that source / rupture,
the pair gets generated out, with a (possibly) :meth:`limited
<openquake.hazardlib.site.SiteCollection.filter>` site collection.

Consistency of filters' input and output stream format allows several filters
(obviously, of the same kind) to be chained together.

Filter functions should not make assumptions about the ordering of items
in the original generator or draw more than one pair at once. Ideally, they
should also perform reasonably fast (filtering stage that takes longer than
the actual calculation on unfiltered collection only decreases performance).

Module :mod:`openquake.hazardlib.calc.filters` exports one distance-based
filter function (see :func:`filter_sites_by_distance_to_rupture`) as well as
a "no operation" filter (`source_site_noop_filter`). There is
a class `SourceFilter` to determine the sites
affected by a given source: the second one uses an R-tree index and it is
faster if there are a lot of sources, i.e. if the initial time to prepare
the index can be compensed. Finally, there is a function
`filter_sites_by_distance_to_rupture` based on the Joyner-Boore distance.

    number of sites within the integration distance. Notice that SourceFilter
    instances can be pickled, but when unpickled the `use_rtree` flag is set to
